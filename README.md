# Earthquake-prediction-analysis
Earthquake Prediction is a machine learning project that analyzes historical seismic data to estimate future earthquake activity. I cleaned and explored the dataset, engineered key features like magnitude and depth, and built predictive models using Python and Scikit-learn to support disaster preparedness and risk assessment.
